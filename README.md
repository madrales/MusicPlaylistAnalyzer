# Music Playlist Analyzer *Final Project*
***

This is a program created and submitted by Mason Adrales for INFOTC 2040 at the University of Missouri. This program is meant to open and read the data from the music playlist file and generate a report with specific questions (as well as the answers to them) using LINQ (*L*anguage *IN*tegrated *Q*uery) to select the data that fits each question.
